This repository contains files used to build the CW transceiver
shown in the YouTube Video at:
https://youtu.be/vxcRsNkiOTE
Some general instructions on how the files are to be used will be found here as well.
Disclaimer: Some folders found here may not be complete. If you think that's preventing you
from being able to use them. Please use the "issues" section or the youtube's comments area 
to describe the problem. Hopefully I will be able to add the missing files.
